# Yolact_detectron2

Reimplement [yolact](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.06218) with detectron2 framework. 

Our code is based on [Detectron2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Detectron2/) framework. Reference it's projects.

So you have to install `Detectron2` firstly.

Specificly, we modify `Retinatnet` detector to as a head of `Yolact`. Although it doesn't work as well as official code, it just a tiny project.
